# Accessibility
Built-in accessibility features for Indux projects.

## Overview

Indux provides built-in accessibility features through its `reset.css` normalizer and base styles. These ensure your applications are accessible by default while maintaining flexibility for custom implementations.

All code snippets in these docs are intended to be semantically correct for screen readers and SEO crawlers.
