## What is Indux?

Indux is inspired and complimented by [Alpine JS](https://alpinejs.dev) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/),  bringing client-side functionality and style directly into HTML.

The Indux framework is a collection of Alpine plugins and CSS stylesheets, each representing a frontend capability that can be used alone or in concert.

## Why Indux?

HTML is the scaffolding of the digital world. It's more written than any human language, and read billions of times a day without being seen. But after 30+ years of evolution, it still lacks native support for much of what modern websites and apps demand—forcing developers to patch it with layers of frameworks that ultimately compile *back* into HTML.

**Indux brings the developer experience home to HTML** (plus a few thoughtfully chosen content formats), making modern web development faster, lighter, and more enjoyable—without sacrificing flexibility or power. Its design philosophies include:

- Plug and play, no build steps.
- Style and function with less code.
- Sprinkle what you need into projects and other frameworks.
- Reduces noise, complexity, and dependencies—for both human and AI developers.
