## Starter Project

```node
npx @indux/starter my-project
```

The starter project contains files and folders to kick start your next app or website, more fully described in [project structure](/projects/starter-project). "my-project" is the modifiable root directory name.

---

### Overview
Indux eliminates the complexity often found in the project structures of larger frameworks like Vue or React. The Indux design philosophy is to streamline development, and this approach includes a straightforward project directory that forgoes abundancy or complexity.

---

### Breakdown
The Indux [starter project](/getting-started/setup) uses this folder structure for both development and deployment:
```
root
├─ 📁 assets
├─ 📁 collections
├─ 📁 html
├─ 📁 scripts
├─ 📁 styles
├─ favicon.ico
├─ index.html
├─ manifest.json
├─ sitemap.xml
└─ robots.txt
```
<Note>Only `index.html` with its Alpine and Indux script references are required for core framework operability.</Note>

#### 📁 root
The root folder (using any name) contains essential configuration and documentation files. Important files include:
- `index.html` as the rendering entry point.
- `manifest.json` as the project configuration file, used to define pages, components, collections, localization, web app settings, and more.
- Website-specific files (`favicon.ico`, `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`) which can be removed for app-only projects.

#### 📁 collections
Indux features a built-in [CMS](docs/cms-collections) for managing content collections in YAML format, facilitating easy maintenance of lists and long-form content.

#### 📁 html
Holds the project's HTML [pages](/pages) like a `home.html`. Subfolders can be used for organization.

#### 📁 scripts
For custom scripts, and typically contains the `indux.min.js` core framework script, though this can exist anywhere in the project directory.
<Note>`indux.min.js` includes Alpine JS baked into it, and a separate Alpine script is not required.</Note>

#### 📁 style
For custom stylesheets, and typically contains Indux's curated CSS:
