## Frameworks

The latest version of Indux is designed to be used with:
- Alpine JS v3 and above
- Tailwind CSS v4 and above

---

## Browsers

The latest version of Indux is designed for and tested on the latest stable versions of Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari. It does not support any version of IE.

Indux only utilizes native language features that have been declared web-standard, but note that older browser versions—or divergent browser like Firefox—may lack support for more modern HTML and CSS capbilities, like HTML's `popover` attribute for modals.
