### Overview
Indux eliminates the complexity often found in the project structures of larger frameworks like Vue or React. The Indux design philosophy is to streamline development, and this approach includes a straightforward project directory that forgoes things like multiple framework files and scoped styles, though you can layer them in from other frameworks as needed.

---

### Breakdown
The Indux [starter project](/getting-started/setup) uses this folder structure for both development and deployment:
```
root
├─ 📁 assets
├─ 📁 components
├─ 📁 content
├─ 📁 pages
├─ 📁 styles
├─ favicon.ico
├─ index.html
├─ indux.min.js
├─ sitemap.xml
└─ robots.txt
```
<Note>Only `index.html`, `indux.min.js`, and the `pages` folder containing at least on page are required for core framework operability.</Note>

#### 📁 root
The root folder (using any name) contains essential configuration and documentation files. Important files include:
- `.gitignore` to exclude files from version control.
- `index.html` as the main entry point for page rendering. Only edit this file when adding custom tags to the `<head>`.
- Website-specific files (`favicon.ico`, `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`) which can be removed for app-only projects.

#### 📁 components
Contains HTML [components](/project/components) that can be applied within pages or other components, e.g.:
- `footer.html` — page footer navigation.
- `header.html` — page header navigation.
- `logo.html` — a brand logo seen around the project.

#### 📁 content
Indux features a built-in [CMS](docs/cms-collections) for managing content in YAML format, facilitating easy maintenance of lists and long-form content. The only default file is:
- `app.yaml` - a mandatory, specialty content file for project configuration.

#### 📁 pages
Holds the project's HTML [pages](/pages) like a `home.html`.

#### 📁 scripts
For custom scripts, and typically contains the `indux.min.js` core framework script, though this can exist anywhere in the project directory.
<Note>`indux.min.js` includes Alpine JS baked into it, and a separate Alpine script is not required.</Note>

#### 📁 style
For custom stylesheets, and typically contains Indux's curated CSS:
