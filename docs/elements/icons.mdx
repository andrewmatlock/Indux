## Setup

Icons are built into the [full framework](/getting-started/setup). For the standalone plugin, insert the plugin and Alpine script in the head or body:

```html
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/indux.icons.js"></script>
    <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/alpinejs@3.x.x/dist/cdn.min.js"></script>
```

## Usage

Icons are inserted into any HTML element with the `icon` or `x-icon` attributes.

```html
<i icon="ph:house"></i>
```

Browse Iconify for available icon values like the example above. The letters before the colon are the icon library code, and the word(s) after are the icon name.

At runtime a child SVG is generated within the parent element.
