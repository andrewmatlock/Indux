  title: A website to lead an industry
  brief: Votion is a rising star in home automation devices for convenience, safety, and security, and needed a bold new site to reflect success.
  overview: >
    Votion's prior Shopify site was becoming a liability. It was a good start to their online presence as a startup, but as business scaled, Director of Business Development Michael found that updating the template without the proper time or design background led to diminishing returns. Their brand recognition and sales traction were not accurately represented by a best-in-class web presence, and it was time for a change.<br><br>"Give us the Apple user experience," they said, which made a lot of sense to us. Votion is a fast-growing player in the world of home IoT devices, and what better way to position themselves at the front of the industry than alongside another great hardware brand. We went a little overboard with the effects and a supercharged CMS that makes product updates lighting fast, but in their words, "this is 20 times better than the old site".<br><br>Check out <a href="https://votion.sitrus.ai" target="_blank">votion.io</a>

  title: Revenue-generating products for prop-tech.
  brief: PremiseHQ is a technology scale-up powering the data of large property portfolios and REITs. Designware delivered a major expansion to their SaaS product line.
  overview: >
    PremiseHQ's GroundFloor platform is the data nexus for a growing camp of forward-thinking real estate portfolios. In the pursuit of total digital automation for property managers, CEO Rafi and his team envisioned the same data under management being leveraged in new and valuable ways: powering each building's dedicated user interfaces. Think marketing and leasing websites, tenant-facing apps, lobby signage, and information kiosks. These deployments would be add-ons to their core SaaS licenses.<br><br>Designware partnered up to develop these projects—website, app, and kiosk templates—using the Sitrus framework for rapid development and scalability, and integration into the SitrusAI platform for API-based publishing automation. All this allows PremiseHQ's clients to customize the look, feel, and content of their digital assets from one place, rather than outsourcing to other departments or vendors. Thanks to Designware, PremiseHQ has the ability to offer its clients realtime software publishing as a major expansion to its core competencies.<br><br>Check out <a href="https://phq-website.sitrus.dev" target="_blank">a PremiseHQ template site</a>.

  title: Bedside infotainment for a better patient experience
  brief: The Hong Kong Sanatorium & Hospital chain is known for its innovations in patient experience. Designware delivered the platform that evolved patient entertainment from TVs to personal touchscreens.
  overview: >
    Designware developed the enterprise Spark platform with HKSH, the premier private hospital group of Southeast Asia, as its anchor client. Coming off the success of the <a href='/client/mcdonalds'>McDonalds games project,</a> we identified the market opportunity for a general-purpose kiosk and digital signage platform that could be fully customized for a variety of environments and business objectives. The Spark client application supports signage, advertising, and embedded Android apps launched directly from within the interface, expanding the user experience to hundreds of thousands of publicly-available apps.<br><br>HKSH integrated Spark into bedside terminals provided by Quanta Computer from their medical touchscreen product line, expanding the patient experience to include food ordering, nurse calling, video calling, video games, facility maps, information, and special notices. HKSH also commissioned development for IPTV support, allowing screens to interface with and broadcast Hong Kong cable channels, a feat we are especially proud of. Our valued colleagues in the HKSH IT department have leveraged both on-premise and cloud-hosted options, and use the Spark CMS to remotely manage their fleet of Spark screens across multiple hospitals.

  title: Touchscreen entertainment for the masses
  brief: Interactive game kiosks are the premier attraction of many McDonalds locations throughout the world, and we developed them.
  overview: >
    Designware was hired to build the software platform by a manufacturing vendor for the 10th generation of touchscreen game kiosks deployed predominantly into McDonalds, alongside other QSR chains and business categories. Interfaces for public environments are amongst the most rigorously used and tested, and this was a challenge we wanted to dive straight into.<br><br>The multi-year engagement saw Designware develop a touchscreen software platform, including the lobby application and game launcher—not unlike what you'd find on an Xbox or PlayStation console. Our backend and network systems provided remote control and diagnostics of deployed units. We also developed and licensed dozens of video games to the platform, included branded titles with media partners NBC Universal, The Jim Henson Company, and the Kung Fu Panda franchise, plus pro athletes like Major League Baseball's Hanley Ramírez, the NFL's Steven Jackson, and Olympic/professional soccer's Alex Morgan.

  title: Gambling research simulator reveals incredible data
  brief: An academic research project drew upon Designware's game development experience to gather new intelligence.
  overview: >
    The University of Waterloo's Gambling Research Lab is a major contributor to the academic research and study of gaming behaviour. In partnership with Ontario's gaming commission and the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Designware was engaged for a very unique project: to build a slot machine.<br><br>The objective was to simulate the physical gaming experience without access to a casino floor or the source code of real slot machines. And so we designed and developed <I>Sands of Splendor</I>, a fictional slots game deployed to touchscreens inside the Lab's own gaming cabinetry. The game featured all the bells and whistles of true slots, including multi-line betting opportunities and bonuses, all running off a random number generator.<br><br>Research participants—including problem gamblers—played our slots while live biometric data was gathered through a variety of sensors. What did we learn? Players consistently registered positive psychological and biological reactions (i.e. dopamine hits) when the game offered rapid and exciting audiovisual effects. This was predominantly triggered during a "fake win" where the user wins less money than bet, but the game celebrates with the exact same feedback loop as a real win. Our takeaway: UI/UX effects are a significant determining factor in a user's continued engagement with slots, and this premise can be seen extended beyond casinos into video games, utility apps, and even workplace tools.
