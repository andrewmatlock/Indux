## What are they?
A component in Indux is a single UI element that’s reused throughout the project. These are saved as standlone HTML files which can be included within any page or other component.

An easy example is a page header, where every header should look and feel the same across all pages. Rather than copy/pasting the header (and its edits) to each page, it’s much more efficient to save the header to a single source of truth and have that referenced by each page.

Components exist to save you time and effort, to centralize design decisions, and make a project more scalable.

### Terminology
Like other abstract development concepts, components can be described in different ways (views, templates, widgets, etc.) Here's the most common verbiage, adopted by Indux throughout the rest of this article:

- **Component** — a generic term used to reference a reusable UI element in its entirety, including the main component and all its instances.

- **Main component** — the source content that lives in a single place. Edits to a main component will effect every instance.

- **Instance** — an individual instance of a component living on a page, or even inside another main component (that’s right, components can be nested where appropriate). Edits to an instance will only affect that instance.

## Applying components
1. In `pages/components`, create a file `name.html` with any name you want, provided it's unique from other components.
2. In the component file, add the `template` tag with its `x-component.unwrap` value matching the file name, and insert HTML content within:<br>

    <figcaption class="text-right">card-example.html</figcaption>

        <template x-component.unwrap="card-example">

            <div class="card w-[300px]">
                <img class="m-0 aspect-[3/2]" src="https://source.unsplash.com/xRzxnnP4ubc">
                <div>
                    <h4 class="mt-0 mb-xs">Card Title></h4>
                    <p class="m-0 line-clamp-3">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

        </template>

    Only a single parent element can exist within the `<template>` tag; subsequent parents will not render.<br><br>


3. In any page that needs to display the component, add its name to the page body tag’s `x-import` attribute, comma-separated with no spaces:

        <body x-data="app" x-cloak x-import=“header,footer,logo,card-example“>


4. Drop instances on the page with the dedicated tag `<x-[name]>`, such as:

        <x-card-example></x-card-example>

    The `<x-...>` tag is replaced with the main component's HTML at runtime.

### Customizing Instances
Any text or attribute within an instance—including the parent element and all descendant elements—can be customized directly from the instance declaration itself. For example, we have the example card component from above with instances applied on each page like:

<div class="bg-pre-border mt-lg p-lg rounded-t-card"><x-card-example></x-card-example></div>
<pre class="mt-0 rounded-t-none"><code>&lt;x-card-example&gt;&lt;/x-card-example&gt;</code></pre>


#### Parent Modification
Modifying only the parent element can be done immediately by adding new content to the `<x-...>` tag:

<div class="bg-pre-border mt-lg p-lg rounded-t-card"><x-card-example class="border border-1 rounded-none shadow-xl"></x-card-example></div>
<pre class="mt-0 rounded-t-none"><code>&lt;x-card-example class=&quot;border border-1 rounded-none shadow-xl&quot;&gt;&lt;/x-card-example&gt;</code></pre>

#### Child Modification
Because only the instance's `<x-...>` tag is editable on the page, we need a way to affect child elements on demand. Let's say we want to:

- Change the image
- Change the title and text
- Change the text container's background color

The solution is to create a custom attribute for each modification, in bold:

<figcaption class="text-right">card-example.html</figcaption>
<div class="bg-pre-border mt-xs p-lg rounded-t-card"><x-card-example></x-card-example></div>

<pre class="mt-0 rounded-t-none"><code>&lt;template x-component.unwrap=&quot;card-example&quot;&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;card w-[300px]&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img class=&quot;m-0 aspect-[3/2]&quot; <b>:src=&quot;$prop('image') ?? 'https://source.unsplash.com/xRzxnnP4ubc'&quot;&gt;</b>
        &lt;div <b>:class=&quot;$prop('color')&quot;&gt;</b>
            &lt;h4 class=&quot;mt-0 mb-xs&quot; <b>x-text=&quot;$prop('title') ?? 'Card Title'&quot;&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;</b>
            &lt;p class=&quot;m-0 line-clamp-3&quot; <b>x-text=&quot;$prop('text') ?? 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.'&quot;</b>&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/template&gt;</code></pre>

Here are the changes:

- Affected attributes like `href` and `class` become `:href` and `:class`. The `:` is a shorthand for `x-bind:`, an Alpine attribute that allows dynamic data binding.
- The `x-text` Alpine attribute is added to text elements with dynamic strings (or `x-html` for rich text).
- `$prop('custom-name')` is the value applied inside these conditional attributes, where `custom-name` is the name of the custom attribute you'll be able to use next.
- The `?? '...'` portions are optional for defining default content. Alternatively, add a separate `x-show="$prop('...')"` attribute to the element to completely omit it when the intance does not define a value for it.

Back to the `<x-card-example>` on the page, we expand the tag to include our custom attributes as needed:
<div class="bg-pre-border mt-lg p-lg rounded-t-card">
    <x-card-example image="https://source.unsplash.com/zOlZgELBMRg" title="Top 10 Best Taco Spots" text="It's that time of year where nothing matters more than shoving a bunch of tacos down your pie hole." color="bg-yellow-100 dark:bg-yellow-900"></x-card-example>
</div>
<pre class="mt-0 rounded-t-none"><code>&lt;x-card-example
    image=&quot;https://source.unsplash.com/zOlZgELBMRg&quot;
    title=&quot;Top 10 Best Taco Spots&quot;
    text=&quot;It's that time of year where nothing matters more than shoving a bunch of tacos down that pie hole of yours.&quot;
    color=&quot;bg-yellow-100 dark:bg-yellow-900&quot;
&gt;&lt;/x-card-example&gt;</code></pre>

#### Injecting CMS Content
Instances can also receive their content from a [CMS collection](docs/cms-collection). Simply make attributes dynamic with a leading `:` and turn the values into CMS references. In this example, we're referencing the `team.json` collection:

<div class="bg-pre-border mt-lg p-lg rounded-t-card">
    <x-card-example :image="cms.team[1].image" :title="cms.team[1].name" :text="cms.team[1].role"></x-card-example>
</div>
<pre class="mt-0 rounded-t-none"><code>&lt;x-card-example
    :image=&quot;cms.team[1].image&quot;
    :title=&quot;cms.team[1].title&quot;
    :text=&quot;cms.team[1].text&quot;
&gt;&lt;/x-card-example&gt;</code></pre>

## Default components
The Indux starter project is preloaded with the following placeholder components:

- `footer.html` — page footer navigation.
- `header.html` — page header navigation.
- `logo.html` — brand logo seen around the project.
- `socials.html` — clickthrough buttons to social media profiles defined in `cms/socials.json`.

You may freely modify or remove these files. When removing a component, be sure to eliminate its declaration in HTML page body tags' `x-import` attribute; failing to do so prevents page rendering.

## When to componentize
You may find yourself wondering whether a UI element needs to be a component. The simplest strategy is to ask yourself if it's more or less effort (and code) to componentize. Let’s break it down:

- **Don’t reinvent HTML.** If the component is supported by a single existing HTML element, like a `<button>` or `<input>`, in essence it’s already been componentized by HTML itself. Componentizing these results in more effort and code, defeating the purpose.

- **Don’t reinvent CSS.** Similarly, CSS declarations already provide a method of sharing styles between elements, which isn't a good reason on its own to componentize.

- **Don’t componentize single-use elements.** Pretty simple—there’s no need for a component if there’s only one instance. Just drop code directly on the page.

- **Don’t componentize an entire page.** Say you’re making a page to display blog posts based on a variable URL like `domain.com/blogs/[blog-post-slug]`. This cannot be accomplished by components on their own because we need to tap into the project’s routing system. See [page templates](docs/pages#template-pages) instead.

- **Do componentize things that are always the same.** Headers, footers, and other common menus are examples of components with identical instances. It’d be crazy not to.

- **Do componentize things that aren’t always the same.** Components are most powerful when they allow you to manipulate an instance’s text and attributes (including styles) on the fly. See how to [customize instances](#customizing-instances) above.

## Considerations
### Nested components
Is it worth putting components inside other components? Sometimes yes! In the Indux starter project, an `<x-logo>` instance is applied within the `header.html` and `footer.html` main components, which in turn get added to pages as `<x-header>` and `<x-footer>`.

Note that circular references (two components referencing each other) cause a rendering loop and should be avoided.

### Component interactions
Say you have a header component with a button that opens a modal. Should the modal's code live inside the header component? That depends—if the modal is unique to the header then no problem.

If the modal can also be opened from elsewhere on the page, it can make more sense to place it directly on the page or as its own component. Components in Indux can freely interact with other components or page code regardless of how or when they were populated, or their position in the page heirarchy.

## Credits
Components are amongst the most complex features developed into frontend frameworks, and for all the benefits of Alpine.js—Indux’ underlying engine—it purposefully steers clear of component support at time of writing, deferring those requirements to the larger server-side frameworks like Vue and React.

A guiding principle of Indux is to remain client-side, so the framework leverages [VimeshUI](https://github.com/vimeshjs/vimesh-ui) from developer Xinjie Zhang, extending Alpine with a robust and customizable component system. Indux natively incorporates VimeshUI using the namespace `x-[component-name]` to match the Alpine attribute syntax.
