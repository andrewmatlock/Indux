## Collections
A content management system (CMS) is a way of creating and managing digital content more efficiently than manual coding. Common CMS use cases include blogs, news articles, portfolio items, product listings, features or services, testimonials or reviews, team members, job roles, and more.

In Indux, CMS functionality is built right into the framework. The `cms` folder stores 
local JSON files, referred to here as CMS collections (of content). The JSON filetype is commonly used for storing and exchaning data on the web, formatted as human-readable text. This makes it easy to manage and update content without having to touch HTML or the rest of the codebase.

## Making a Collection
1. In the `cms` folder, create a JSON file with the name of your collection. For example, if you want to create a collection of team members, you could name your file `team.json`.

2. Fill the JSON file with your CMS content. Here's an example using the creators of the Indux framework:

    <figcaption class="text-right">team.json</figcaption>

        [
            {
                "name": "Andrew Matlock",
                "role": "Product & Development",
                "image": "/assets/team/andrew.webp"
            },
            {
                "name": "Jeff Dyson",
                "role": "Architecture & Development",
                "image": "/assets/team/jeff.webp"
            },
            {
                "name": "Jess Fulkerson",
                "role": "Design & Development",
                "image": "/assets/team/jess.webp"
            }
        ]

3. Update `app.json` in the root folder to register the collection. This can be done in one of two ways:

    - **For all pages** — if the collection has content that will be used on every page, edit the top-level `"cms": { "files" }` property with comma-separated files in quotes:

            "cms": {
                "path": "cms/",
                "files": [ "general.json", "team.json" ]
            },

    - **For specific pages** — to boost performance, load collections only into pages that require them. To do so, go to the `"pages"` property, and under the respective page modify its `"cms"` sub-property to include the file in quotes (comma-separated if multiple):

            "about": {
                    "file": "pages/about.html",
                    "cms": [ "team.json" ],
                    "routes": [
                    {
                        "path": "about"
                    }
                ]
            },

## Injecting Content into HTML
In HTML, Alpine attributes are used to fetch and display a collection's content. The reference path to a collection—and a specific content property—uses dot notation formatted as `"cms.[collection].[property].[sub-property]"`:

    <p x-text="cms.team[0].name"></p>

In the above example we're accessing the `team.json` collection, specifically the first member's `"name"`. The `[0]` is required to grab the first item of an array, which in JavaScript starts at 0 rather than 1. The `[#]` counter is not required when referncing non-array properties.

### Text
Text gets added to HTML from a collection using the `x-text` Alpine attribute:

    <h4 x-text="cms.hero.title"></h4>


### Rich Text
`x-text` only works for raw strings. To inject text that includes HTML tags like `<a>` links, use `x-html` instead:

    <h4 x-html="cms.hero.title"></h4>

### Attributes
Not all collection content is text; sometimes you need to fetch an image path, link, or other attribute. This is done with Alpine's `x-bind:` attribute, shortened to `:` and bound to the respective attribute like `:class`, `:style`, `:href`, or `:src`:

    <img :src="cms.hero.image" alt="Hero Image">


### Listed Content
It's common to have items in a collection be intended for HTML rendering as a list of text or cards. This is done by storing the respective content in an array, and setting up a loop in the HTML to iterate through the array.

1. Setup the collection's array. This can be a top-level array like in the `team.json` example above, where the entire JSON file is one big array. Alternatively, it can be an array nested within another object.

2. In the HTML, use the `<template>` tag to create a loop:


<div class="row gap-lg p-lg bg-pre-border rounded-t-card overflow-x-scroll">
    <template x-for="person in cms.team">
        <div class="card w-[250px] min-w-[250px] bg-page shadow">
            <img class="aspect-square mt-0 mb-xs" :src="person.image" :alt="person.name">
            <div>
                <p class="m-0 font-bold" x-text="person.name"></p>
                <small class="m-0" x-text="person.role"></small>
            </div>
        </div>
    </template>
</div>
<pre class="mt-0 rounded-t-none"><code>&lt;template x-for=&quot;person in cms.team&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;card w-[250px] min-w-[250px] bg-page shadow&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img class=&quot;aspect-square mb-xs&quot; :src=&quot;person.image&quot; :alt=&quot;person.name&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;p class=&quot;font-bold&quot; x-text=&quot;person.name&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;small x-text=&quot;person.role&quot;&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;</code></pre>

To make this work, `x-for` is used to loop through the array of content. The syntax is `x-for="item in cms.[collection]"`, where `item` is an arbitrary name used to reference the current item in the loop.  

In the example above, `person` is the arbitrary name, with `person.image`, `person.name`, and `person.role` being specific content references.

Similar to [components](/docs/components), the `<template>` tag will not render in the DOM, but its contents will. Additionally, the tag can only have a single parent element within it, and subsequent parents will not render.

### Markdown Content
Markdown files (.md) are a popular way to write long-form content for the web, like blog posts or these very help docs—you're reading `assets/docs/cms-collections.md` right now. Markdown files are a great supplement for CMS collections that need to store rich text articles; rather than storing every article in a bloated JSON file and delivering it to HTML with `x-html`, we simply store the article's path:

    {
        "name": "From Russia With Love",
        "article": "assets/reviews/from-russia-with-love.md"
    },
    {
        "name": "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade",
        "article": "assets/reviews/last-crusade.md"
    },
    {
        "name": "The Hunt for Red October",
        "article": "assets/reviews/red-october.md"
    }

... More to come.

### Template Pages
Sometimes it's useful to have a collection's content display based on the page's variable URL, like `domain.com/blog/[blog-post-name]`. See [template pages](docs/pages#template-pages) for instructions.

## Default Collections
The Indux starter project comes with a handful of collections, pre-wired into the respective pages and components for common use cases:

- `blog.json` stores blog content, referencing markdown posts in `assets/blogs`.

- `docs.json` powers these very help docs, referencing markdown articles in `assets/docs`. Overwrite the collection to populate your project's own knowledge base.

- `legal.json` contains the project's legal info and references placeholder user agreements (markdown files) in `assets/legal`.

- `social.json` stores the project's social media links, which automatically populate clickthrough buttons in the `socials.html` component.

- `team.json` is a placeholder collection for the project's team members (used in the [example above](#listed-content), with references to profile pics in `assets/team`.
