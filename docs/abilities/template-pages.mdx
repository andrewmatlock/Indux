Template pages get their content structure from a single HTML file, but use a variable URL slug to display unique content from a CMS collection.

A practical example are blog posts, where each post requires a consistent page appearance, but its URL slug and the content are unique. Template pages for [blogs](docs/blogs), [help docs](docs/help-docs), and [end user legal agreements](docs/legal) are already setup for convenience in the Indux starter project.

To add a new template page, we need to update three things:

1. **CMS Collection.** First, establish a [collection](docs/cms-collections) in the `cms` folder. The collection for a template page is easiest managed as a top-level array, like in this example:
```products.json
[
    {
        "path": "toaster",
        "name": "Toaster",
        "price": "$99"
    },
    {
        "path": "microwave",
        "name": "Microwave",
        "price": "$199"
    },
    {
        "path": "air-fryer",
        "name": "Air Fryer",
        "price": "$299"
    }
]
```
    Note that the array objects must have a property for the URL slug, in this case `path`.

2. **Template Page.** Next, let's generate a new HTML document in `pages` to display the template content:
```product.html
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, viewport-fit=cover">
    <title>Page Name</title>
    <meta name="description" content="">
    <meta name="author" content="">
</head>

<body x-data="$store.app" x-cloak x-import="logo,header,footer,socials">

    <main>

        <h1 text="cms.product.name"></h1>
        <h5 text="cms.product.price"></h5>

    </main>

</body>
</html>
```

Note that on template pages, the reference path to the connected CMS collection is `cms.[prop]`, with `prop` established in the `app.json` step below. This will automatically fill the page's CMS references based on the current URL slug.

If you need to reference other CMS collections unrelated to the URL, use the full dot notation syntax for store references in Indux: `$store.app.cms.[collection].[property]`.

3. **app.json.** To bring it all together, we need to establish the page in `app.json` under the `"pages"` array, and modify its `routes` properties to reference the CMS collection based on URL slug. Here's the required page snippet:
```app.json
"pages": {
    ...
    "active": {
        ...

        "product": {
            "file": "/pages/product.html",
            "cms": [ ],
            "routes": [
                {
                "path": "product/:cms",
                "cms": "products.path",
                "prop": "product"
                }
            ]
        },

        ...
    }
}
```
In the above example:

- `"path"` designates the URL structure, which can include arbitrary nested slugs like `product/`. The final slug always needs to be `:cms`.
- `"cms"` specifies the CMS collection and the array object property used to define the path's value for `:cms` above. In the case of `"products.path"`, "products" is the CMS collection (`products.json`) and `path` is the property in the array objects that decides what the slug string is.
- `"prop"` specifies how the CMS collection is referenced in your template HTML page, like `<h1 x-text="cms.product.name"><h1>`, where `product` is the prop value. This differs from regular CMS references that require the collection name.

## Linking
Linking from one page to another is easy: `<a href="page-name">Page Name</a>`, where `page-name` is the one you defined in `app.json`. Do not add a `/` in front of the path as this will prevent routing.

### Anchor Links
Link to specific content on a page with `<a href="page-name#anchor">Link Text</a>`, where `anchor` is the unique `id` of the target element, i.e. `<h1 id="anchor">Come see me!</h1>`. Indux supports smooth scrolling by default, enabling the user to glide to the new spot on the page.

## Content Structure
Pages should be semantically accurate and SEO-optimized. We suggest this best practice for the body element heirarchy:
```html
<pre><code>&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;x-header&gt;&lt;/x-header&gt;
    &lt;main&gt;
        &lt;section&gt; ... &lt;/section&gt;
        &lt;section&gt; ... &lt;/section&gt;
        &lt;section&gt; ... &lt;/section&gt;
    &lt;/main&gt;
    &lt;x-footer&gt;&lt;/x-footer&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;</code></pre>
```
- `<x-header>` and `<x-footer>` are injected components containing pre-styled `<header>` and `<footer>` tags. The components can be removed or overwritten, but we suggested containing any main navigation in the appropriate tags.
- `<main>` can only appear once to represent the main content of the page.
- Nested `<section>` tags break page content into distinct sections, pre-styled to enforce negative space and screen edge padding.
