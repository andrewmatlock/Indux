## Overview

Indux's normalizer provides a modern CSS reset and normalization library that ensures consistent rendering across browsers. It's based on Normalize.css and Tailwind's Preflight, with additional optimizations for modern web development.

---

## Setup

Reset styles are available in the full Indux CSS library, or as a standalone stylesheet for independent use.

<CodeGroup>
```html Indux CSS
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/indux/dist/indux.css">
```
```html Standalone
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/indux/dist/indux.reset.css">
```
</CodeGroup>

Reset styles have no dependencies or theme references, and can be used as-is in any project or framework.
