## Overview
Content collections are local JSON or YAML files that store content for use in HTML. They maintain highly repetitive or reusable content in a central, human-readable format.

<Note>Similar to HTML and CSS, collection files are maintained client-side and should not contain sensitive data.</Note>

---

## Setup

Add an [Indux script](/getting-started/setup) to your project, or use the standalone collections plugin:

```html
<!-- Alpine -->
<script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/alpinejs@3.x.x/dist/cdn.min.js"></script>

<!-- Indux Collections plugin -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/indux/dist/indux.collections.js"></script>
```

---

## Create Collections

Create a JSON or YAML file anywhere in your project, such as `/collections/team.json` or `team.yaml`. The filetypes are treated the same and their only distinction is developer preference. A collection's filename must be unique from other collections.

<CodeGroup>
```html team.json
[
    {
        "name": "Darth Vader",
        "role": "Lord",
        "image": "/assets/team/vader.webp"
    },
    {
        "name": "Admiral Piett",
        "role": "Fleet Commander",
        "image": "/assets/team/piett.webp"
    },
    {
        "name": "Captain Needa",
        "role": "Vacated",
        "image": "/assets/team/needa.webp"
    }
]
```
```html team.yaml
- name: Darth Vader
  role: Lord
  image: /assets/team/vader.webp
- name: Admiral Piett
  role: Fleet Commander
  image: /assets/team/piett.webp
- name: Captain Needa
  role: Vacated
  image: /assets/team/needa.webp
```

Files can use any content formatting, e.g. objects, array objects, or a top-level array.

<Warning>JSON files will break with a single syntax error. Validators like [JSON Lint](https://jsonlint.com/) will help identify issues.</Warning>

## Register Collections

Register collections in `manifest.json` so they can be accessed in HTML.

```json manifest.json
{
    ...
    "collections": {
        "team": "/collections/team.json",
        "features": "/collections/features.yaml",
        "locale": {
            "en": "/collections/locale/en.yaml",
            "fr": "/collections/locale/fr.yaml"
        }
    },
    ...
}
```

Collections also support localization through the manifest configuration. See [Localization](/plugins/localization) for details.

## Apply Collections to HTML

Collections are accessed in HTML using Indux's `$x` magic method. The syntax follows `$x.[collectionName]` to reference a collection, with additional dot notation for nested properties. Collections are loaded on-demand and cached for the session duration.

### Text Content

Use `x-text` to display text content from collections:

<CodeGroup>
```html HTML
<h4 x-text="$x.team[0].name"></h4>
<p x-text="$x.team[0].role"></p>
```
```html team.yaml
- name: Darth Vader
  role: Lord
  image: /assets/team/vader.webp
- name: Admiral Piett
  role: Fleet Commander
  image: /assets/team/piett.webp
- name: Captain Needa
  role: Vacated
  image: /assets/team/needa.webp
```
</CodeGroup>

In the above example, the team collection consists of a top-level array, and the first item is referenced with `[0]`, the next with `[1]`, and so on. For object properties, use dot notation without brackets. Note that arrays must be nested within objects to coexist with other properties:

<CodeGroup>
```html HTML
<p>Celebrating <span x-text="$x.team.accidents.days"></span> days of safety.</p>
```
```html team.yaml
members:
  - name: Darth Vader
    role: Lord
    image: /assets/team/vader.webp
  - name: Admiral Piett
    role: Fleet Commander
    image: /assets/team/piett.webp
  - name: Captain Needa
    role: Vacated
    image: /assets/team/needa.webp
accidents:
  days: 2
```
</CodeGroup>

---

### Rich Text

Use `x-html` to display content that includes HTML tags:

```html
<div x-html="$x.blog[0].content"></div>
```

---

### Attributes

Use `x-bind:` (or `:`) to bind collection data to HTML attributes:

```html
<img :src="$x.team[0].image" :alt="$x.team[0].name">
<a :href="$x.team[0].linkedin">LinkedIn</a>
```

---

### Listed Content

Use `<template x-for>` to iterate through collection arrays:

<Frame>
<div class="row gap-6">
    <div class="grow w-[160px] min-w-[160px] shadow">
        <img class="aspect-square object-cover mt-0 mb-xs" src="/assets/team/vader.jpg" alt="Darth Vader" />
        <div>
            <p class="font-bold">Darth Vader</p>
            <span>Lord</span>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="grow w-[160px] min-w-[160px] shadow">
        <img class="aspect-square object-cover mt-0 mb-xs" src="/assets/team/piett.webp" alt="Admiral Piett" />
        <div>
            <p class="font-bold">Admiral Piett</p>
            <span>Fleet Commander</span>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="grow w-[160px] min-w-[160px] shadow">
        <img class="aspect-square object-cover mt-0 mb-xs" src="/assets/team/needa.webp" alt="Captain Needa" />
        <div>
            <p class="font-bold">Captain Needa</p>
            <span>Vacated</span>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
</Frame>

```html
<template x-for="person in $x.team">
    <!-- Templates can only have one root element -->
    <div>
        <img :src="person.image" :alt="person.name">
        <div>
            <p x-text="person.name"></p>
            <small x-text="person.role"></small>
        </div>
    </div>
</template>
```

The `<template>` tag creates a loop through the collection array. The syntax `x-for="item in $x.[collectionName]"` iterates through each item, where `item` is an arbitrary name used to reference the current item in the loop. If the array being referenced is a nested property in the collection, target it with dot notation (e.g. `$x.team.members`).

You can also use Alpine's filtering methods like `filter()`, `map()`, `sort()`, and `slice()`, or filter based on URL query parameters using the `$query` magic method from the [URL Queries](/plugins/url-queries) plugin.
