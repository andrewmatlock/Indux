## From Data Sources

Markdown files (.md) are a popular way to write long-form content for the web, like blog posts or these very help docsâ€”you're reading `assets/docs/cms-collections.md` right now. Markdown files are a great supplement for CMS collections that need to store rich text articles; rather than storing every article in a bloated JSON file and delivering it to HTML with `x-html`, we simply store the article's path:

```json films.json
    {
        "name": "From Russia With Love",
        "article": "assets/reviews/from-russia-with-love.md"
    },
    {
        "name": "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade",
        "article": "assets/reviews/last-crusade.md"
    },
    {
        "name": "The Hunt for Red October",
        "article": "assets/reviews/red-october.md"
    }
```
