## Overview

With the router plugin, Indux turns your project into a single-page application (SPA), where URL paths can be used to show or hide any element, including [components](/plugins/components).

<Note>Indux routing should be used independent of other routing systems or frameworks.</Note>

---

## Setup

Add an [Indux bundle](/getting-started/setup) to your project, or use the standalone router plugin:

```html
<!-- Alpine -->
<script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/alpinejs@3.x.x/dist/cdn.min.js"></script>

<!-- Indux Router plugin -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/indux/dist/indux.router.js"></script>
```

## Routing

`index.html` is the entrypoint for rendering, where high-level elements, layout structures, and [components](/plugins/components) can be applied. Within `index.html` or any component HTML file, use the `x-route` attribute to make any element conditional on a URL path.

<CodeGroup>
```html index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        ...
    </head>
    <body>
        <x-header></x-header>
        <main>

            <!-- Only renders at the base domain -->
            <x-home x-route="/"></x-home>

            <!-- Only renders at the /about route -->
            <h1 x-route="about">About Us</h1>
            <x-about x-route="about"></x-about>

        </main>
        <x-footer></x-footer>
    </body>
</html>
```

```html home.html
<div>There's no place like home</div>
```

```html about.html
<div>All about the Benjamins</div>
```

</CodeGroup>

If an element in `index.html` has no `x-route` attribute or value, it will render on all routes. Use `/` for rendering only at the base domain route (e.g. `acme.com`).

---

### Wildcard Routes

A wildcard route can be used to match any route that starts with the given path.

```html
<div x-route="about/*">...</div>
```

This will match any route that has a subpage after `/about/`, such as `/about/location` or `/about/team`. It will not render for `/about` on its own. Conversely, `x-route="about"` will render for both `/about` and all subpages since the value always matches one of the slugs.

---

### Multiple Routes

Multiple comma-separated values allow the element to render if any of the routes match the current route.

```html
<div x-route="/,about,contact">...</div>
```

---

### Omitted Routes

A leading `!` in front of a value will hide the element from that route.

```html
<div x-route="!features,!pricing">...</div>
```

---

### Undefined Routes

Use `!*` to show an element on a route that is not defined by any other `x-route` attributes. Note that a bare wildcard `*` will appear at all routes, including those that are undefined.

<Note>Indux does not require a declared route to render, and a non-existent route like `/no-bueno` will still render any elements in `index.html` that don't have conflicting `x-route` conditions.</Note>

---

## Page Head Content

The static content in the `index.html` `<head>` tag is global across all routes. To make head content like the title, metas, scripts, or stylesheets conditional to a specific route, place them in a `<template data-head>` tag, subject to its own route condition or that of a parent's.

<CodeGroup>
```html index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        ...
    </head>
    <body>

        <!-- The script will only append to the head in the base and /about routes -->
        <template data-head x-route="/,about">
            <script>
                console.log('Always use your head');
            </script>
        </template>

        <!-- Specialty page component -->
        <x-specialty x-route="specialty"></x-specialty>

    </body>
</html>
```

```html specialty.html
<!-- These assets only append to the head if the specialty page component is rendered -->
<template data-head>
    <title>Specialty Page</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles/specialty.css">
    <script src="/scripts/specialty.js"></script>
</template>

<!-- data-head content can also be nested in a route-specific container -->
 <div x-route="specialty/*">
    <template data-head>
        <script src="/scripts/even-more.js"></script>
    </template>
</div>

...
```
</CodeGroup>

## URL Queries

See the Indux plugins for [localization](/plugins/localization) and [URL queries](/plugins/url-queries) that can inject additional information into the URL.
