## Carousels

Carousels are a great way to display content in a scrollable area. They are often used to display images, but can be used to display any type of content.

## Setup

Add an [Indux script](/getting-started/setup) to your project, or use the standalone carousels plugin:

```html
<!-- Alpine -->
<script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/alpinejs@3.x.x/dist/cdn.min.js"></script>

<!-- Indux Carousels plugin -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/indux/dist/indux.carousels.js"></script>
```
